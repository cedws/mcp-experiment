# mcp-experiment

Simple experiment/example of joining the OpenAI SDK with a [microsandbox](https://github.com/microsandbox/microsandbox) MCP server running on localhost using [mark3labs/mcp-go](https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go).

This experiment essentially gives any model via OpenRouter access to arbitary code execution in a Python sandbox via microsandbox's MCP server.
